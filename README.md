## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### 1. üß± Code or Feature Generation
- Use **Cursor** to scaffold React components (Navbar, About, Projects, Contact forms).  
- Ask AI to generate **responsive Tailwind CSS layouts**.  
- Use prompts for reusable utility functions (e.g., form validation).  

## Prompt Strategy
1. **For code generation**  
**used Prompts:** 

> ‚ÄúGenerate a responsive Next.js portfolio landing page hero component.
File: components/Hero.tsx
- Client component
- Use Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for animations
- Props: none (hardcode name + short bio for now)
- Include accessible semantics (role="banner", h1 for name, p for bio, button with aria-label)‚Äù

> ‚ÄúCreate a Next.js App Router projects page.
File: app/projects/page.tsx
- Server component
- Import Project[] data from data/projects.ts
- Render responsive grid of ProjectCard components
- Use Tailwind responsive grid classes‚Äù


> ‚ÄúCreate a ProjectCard component.
File: components/ProjectCard.tsx
Props: 
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  techStack: string[];
  repoUrl?: string;
  liveUrl?: string;
  image?: string;
}
Requirements:
- Render title, description, tech badges
- Display repoUrl and liveUrl as accessible links
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, include placeholder image if image is missing
- Accessible markup (aria-labels on links)‚Äù

---

### 2. üß™ Testing Support
- Used **Jest + React Testing Library** for component testing.  

**Used Prompts:**  
> ‚ÄúWrite a Vitest + Testing Library test for ProjectCard.
File: components/ProjectCard.test.tsx
- Render component with mocked Project props
- Assert title, description, and tech badges render correctly
- Assert repoUrl and liveUrl render if provided
- Use screen.getByText / getByRole‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWrite tests for ContactForm component.
File: components/ContactForm.test.tsx
- Check required fields validation (name, email, message)
- Mock global.fetch
- Assert successful submission calls fetch with correct body
- Use Vitest + @testing-library/react‚Äù

3. **For documentation**  
- Use AI to generate docstrings and inline comments explaining intent and edge cases.
**Used Prompts:**  
   > ‚ÄúAdd JSDoc-style comments
- Document each prop and its purpose
- Describe edge cases and assumptions
- Keep comments concise but clear‚Äù  

---

### 3. üì° Schema-Aware or API-Aware Generation
- Context-aware scaffolding
When adding server/API code, provided the AI with file context (anchors like #File or @file) so outputs match codebase conventions.
  - Use AI to generate CRUD routes for projects.  
  - Feed schema definitions into Cursor for context-aware generation.  

**used Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúBased on this Mongoose schema for a project model, generate CRUD endpoints.‚Äù

---

### 4. üîç In-Editor/PR Review Tooling
- Use CodeRabbit and built-in Cursor review to review diffs.
- Use AI to generate clear commit messages and PR summaries.
  - Suggest better commit messages.  
  - Generate PR summaries.  
  - Catch redundant code or unused imports.  
  - Improve documentation in real-time.
